Directories for Umple plugins to various text editors

The idea is that we should have plugins to essentially every popular text or model editor so people can use Umple natively in those environments. These should do syntax highlighting at the very least. Ideally they would add additional intelligence such context assist, interfacing to the compiler, etc.

Consider contributing Umple-enabling plugins to other open source projects. If you do that, please add a link in this file.
