Copy umple.xml into the modes folder in the jEdit settings directory.
Edit the catalog file in the same folder to contain the following lines. Make sure
that the lines appear between the <MODES> and </MODES> tags in the file.

<MODE NAME="umple"		FILE="umple.xml"
				FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.ump" />


jEdit will now have Umple specific syntax highlighting when .ump files are opened in it.
