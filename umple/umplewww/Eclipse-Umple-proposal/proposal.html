<h2>Background</h2>

<!-- 
	Optionally provide the background that has lead you to creating this project.
 -->

<p>In our research at the University of Ottawa, we made several observations:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Adoption of model-driven development, especially in the open source community, is taking place very slowly. Our surveys of practitioners showed several reasons:</p></li>

	<li><p>Graphical modeling tools tended to be either very heavy-weight, very expensive or both. </p></li>

	<li><p>A large number of developers like to work in a textual manner, in preference to graphically, for a variety of reasons, including a perception that they can create and edit text more rapidly, they can use it with other tools, version control environments, product-line environments, and inspection processes more readily</p></li>

	<li><p>The code generation capabilities of existing open source modeling tools are weak. Many such tools only generate stubs. If they do generate functional code, it tends to miss much of the semantics specified in UML.</p></li>

	<li><p>The tools for exchanging models (XMI format in particular) in fact tend not to be mutually compatible.</p></li>

	<li><p>Students, and even industrial practitioners, are not learning modelling readily due to lack of easy-to-use pedagogical environments, lack of expertise among educators, lack of small and large examples to study and emulate, widely propagated misconceptions about modeling, inability to generate real systems from simple models to get a feedback loop, and complexity of modeling language specifications.</p></li>

	<li><p>Programming languages don't have constructs such as state machines and associations, even though they could be enhanced to incorporate UML modeling constructs fairly easily.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As a result we set out to construct Umple. The initial ideas were conceptualized in the mid 2000's. The first version of Umple was created in the Masters thesis of Dusan Brestovansky in 2007. Since then Umple has been developed as part of several PhD and Masters theses. A list of publications describing Umple can be found at
http://publications.umple.org</p>



<h2>Scope</h2>

<!-- 
	All projects must have a well-defined scope. Describe, concisely, what
	is in-scope and (optionally) what is out-of-scope. An Eclipse project
	cannot have an open-ended scope.

<h2>Description</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe the project here. Be concise, but provide enough information that
	somebody who doesn't already know very much about your project idea or domain
	has at least a fighting chance of understanding its purpose.
 -->
 
Umple, In short, is a compiler, written in itself that adds modeling abstractions to
languages such as Java, PhP and C++ (targeting gcc and Microsoft visual studio). Its core
tools are a standalone command-line compiler, an Eclipse plugin and a website for
educational and demonstration use. To a programmer, Umple appears as a programming
language with advanced features (state machines, associations, concurrency constructs,
patterns) that are specified directly in the code, harmoniously with the other code. To a
modeller, Umple appears as a textual way to write UML and embed Java, PhP and/or C++
directly in the model.

See http://try.umple.org for the demonstration website
http://code.umple.org for the current open source site
http://manual.umple.org for the full-featured generated user manual
http://dl.umple.org for various ways to download Umple
and http://metamodel.umple.org for the generated UML class diagram of the system with
hot links to documentation and live code. 

In Umple, we have followed a rigorous but agile development process. Some features of that process include:

  - Test driven development: We have several thousand test cases, and we have zero tolerance for test failure in a commit or patch. New contributions must include executable tests that demonstrate the correct functioning of the feature.
  
  - Self-reflexive system: Umple is written in itself. The Umple compiler therefore is a very large test case.
  
  - Continuous integration: Every commit triggers a build (a committer is responsible for fixing the build if he doesn't follow proper process, resulting in a broken build). On every build the system is first built with the most recent version of the compiler, then rebuild with the version just built. Following every successful build, a new 'bleeding edge' version of the compiler is publicly available. UmpleOnline always uses this version.

The research that has developed Umple has come through several grants. Sponsors of those grants have been IBM (from the very beginning), Ericsson, General Motors, Malina and the Governments of Canada (NSERC) and Ontario (ORF). Funding for the next three years is secure.

 
<h2>Why Eclipse?</h2> 

<!-- 
	Answer these two questions:	What value does this project bring to the Eclipse
	community? What value do you expect to obtain from hosting your project at Eclipse?
	
	What value do you get by having your project at Eclipse over and above the value
	of hosting at Eclipse Labs?
 -->

Umple needs the visibility and IP policies that an organization like Eclipse can provide, in order to help foster industrial uptake.

Since Umple has been developed in Eclipse, and has an Eclipse plugin as one of its main artifacts, the Eclipse foundation seems the right home.



Also according to XXXX Eclipse is one of the most open of open-source initiatives. Umple has always prided itself in being extremely open, and we want this to continue.

The main benefits Umple would bring to Eclipse would be:
  - A flexible tool to allow integration of textual model constructs right into code in
one or more languages. The textual form allows models and code to be seen as a unified
artifact, facilitating version control, product-line development, bug tracking, etc. But
the model can still be edited graphically.
  - A new sophisticated code generation capability that we believe might be the best
availale in open source. Two PhD theses have gone into our state machine generation and
UML association generation. We handle infinte nesting and concurrency levels, plus
referential integrity and many other issues.
  - The only modeling tool written in itself, demonstrating the power of model-driven
development and helping assure quality.
  - A flexible architecture that allows interaction with many tools both inside and
outside the Eclipse ecosystem (e.g. we can plug in code generators, diagram generators,
export generators, fairly easily and can extend the language easily)



<h2>Initial Contribution</h2>

<!-- 
	Projects are expected to arrive at Eclipse with existing code.
	
	Describe the existing code that will be contributed to the project. Please provide
	a couple of paragraphs describing the code with modest detail, including important
	information like code ownership (who holds the copyright?), and some consideration
	of community that exists around the code. Include a listing of third-party libraries 
	and associated licenses.
 -->

Umple has been an open source project under Google Code since 2011. It is licensed under the MIT license. Copyright is jointly held by the contributors, who, by virtue of agreeing to release their contributions under the MIT license have allowed their work to be freely used.


 
<h2>Legal Issues</h2>

<!-- 
	Please describe any potential legal issues in this section. Does somebody else
	own the trademark to the project name? Is there some issue that prevents you
	from licensing the project under the Eclipse Public License? Are parts of the 
	code available under some other license? Are there any LGPL/GPL bits that you
	absolutely require?
 -->
 
There should be no important legal issues that we are aware of. The project is under the MIT license. We have no objection to converting to the Eclipse Public License going forward. 

The project does have dependencies on some other Eclipse projects (e.g. Jet). The website also uses CodeMirror and JQuery which are licensed under the MIT license.

There is the issue of the generated code. When code is emitted it no license is injected, Our concept is that the original model can have whatever license users want, and the generated code would have the same license.

There is also the issue of the example Umple code and models. In order to foster uptake of Umple, we would like to allow people to freely copy and paste from these examples. The MIT license seems ideal for that;
 
<h2>Committers</h2>

<!-- 
	List any initial committers that should be provisioned along with the
	new project. Include affiliation, but do not include email addresses at
	this point.
 -->

<p>The following individuals are proposed as initial committers to the project:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Committer 1, Affiliation</dt>
	<dd>Committer 1 is a committer on the *** project where he has made significant contributions over

	</dd>
</dl>

<p>We welcome additional committers and contributions.</p>

<!-- 
	Describe any initial contributions of code that will be brought to the 
	project. If there is no existing code, just remove this section.
 -->

<h2>Mentors</h2>

<!-- 
	New Eclipse projects require a minimum of two mentors from the Architecture
	Council. You need to identify two mentors before the project is created. The
	proposal can be posted before this section is filled in (it's a little easier
	to find a mentor when the proposal itself is public).
 -->

<p>The following Architecture Council members will mentor this
project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ian Bull</li>
	<li>To be determined</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interested Parties</h2>

<!-- 
	Provide a list of individuals, organisations, companies, and other Eclipse
	projects that are interested in this project. This list will provide some
	insight into who your project's community will ultimately include. Where
	possible, include affiliations. Do not include email addresses.
 -->

<p>The following individuals, organisations, companies and projects have 
expressed interest in this project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Somebody, Affiliation</li>
	<li>Somebody else, Affiliation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Scheduling</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe, in rough terms, what the basic scheduling of the project will
	be. You might, for example, include an indication of when an initial contribution
	should be expected, when your first build will be ready, etc. Exact
	dates are not required.
 -->

<p>
We would like to convert to Eclipse in mid-summer 2013 (July).
</p>

<p>
This is a mature project with users and ongoing rapid development. There are also gradate students working on Umple as part of their thesis. We want to avoid disrupting their work. 
</p>

<p>
As a result, during the proposal and initial Eclipse incubation pase, we  will route all commits to Coogle Code and also to Eclipse until the Eclipse-based environment is stable. At this point the plan would be to number the first non-incubation release as 2.0.
</p>

<p>
Other mirrors would then become downstream to the Eclipse version.
</p>
