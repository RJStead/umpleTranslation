This directory contains the static files that need to be deployed
to the directory /h/ralph/sites/www/html/umple on the server cruise.site.uottawa.ca
or any other site hosting a mirror of the Umple home page, user manual or UmpleOnline.

All these files (except this README) should be copied to the server when a deploy is done.

These files include the umple home page (index.html) and the support files that
it uses to display its content.
