// This first example uses attribute notation
// The address is required on the constructor, but
// can be null. An instance of Address can be
// considered to be contained within the
// Person class.
//
// Although there is nothing currently preventing
// the same address instance from being re-used in
// multiple classes, it is strongly suggested to
// avoid that. If you want to reuse the same
// Address, then use association notation instead.
class Person {
  name;
  
  // The following uses a class as the attribute type
  Address address;
}

class Address {
  street;
  city;
  postalCode;
