/*
Example to show how to define inline mixsets. 
*/

// The mixset M1 has been defined as inline mixset. this because the definition of the mixset is followed by a class definition. 
mixset M1 class A { 
  isA B;
  isA C;
  x;
}

// M1 also is inline mixset because it has been followed by a trait definition without curly brackets. 
// The usuall definition of M1 is: 
/* 
mixset M1 
{ 
  trait B 
  { 
    y;
  }
} 
*/  
mixset M1 trait B 
{ 
  y;
}


// M2 is an inline mixset that defines an interface.
mixset M1 interface C { void method(); }


class D {
  // M3 adds an attribute for class D. It's an inline mixset since there is no mention to which a class attr1 belongs to.
  // However, Umple parser understands this implicit definition. Therefore, the attr1 will be added to the class D.   
  mixset M3 {attr1;}
  
  }


//The line below will cause error since the interface E is empty.
//Mixset M4 interface E {}

use M1; use M2; use M3;
