<h2>Umple compiler error raised when an internal crash occurs</h2>

<p>
Occasionally the Umple compiler may crash with certain code input,
causing an error in the parsing phase (E9000), analysis phase (E9100)
or generation phase (E9200). As soon as the Umple development team
becomes aware of such a situation, we try to deal with it with
a high level of priority.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the Umple development team is aware of the problem, please 
<a href="https://github.com/umple/umple/issues/new">report the issue</a>, including
the code that generated the error and the stack trace that accompanied the message.<br/>
</p>
