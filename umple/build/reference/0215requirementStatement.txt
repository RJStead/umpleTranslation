Comments and Requirements
noreferences
@@tooltip Defined requirements can be implemented multiple times throughout the code through an implementsReq statement.

@@description
Requirements allow for the same comment to appear in different sections of the code without typing out the comment multiple times.

<p>They consist of two components: the requirement definition, which contains the comment statement to be added, and the requirement implementation, which specifies where the requirement statement should be added.<p>

<p>Multiple requirements can be called through an implementsReq statement.<p>
