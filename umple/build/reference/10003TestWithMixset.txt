Test with Mixset

@@description
<p>Tests can be integrated with mixsets to enhance feature-based testing. This allows the user to toggle feature-specific tests using a mixset dedicated for testcases that can be switched on using the <i>use mixsetTest;</i> statement. The following example shows how to create a mixset for testing another mixset. Note the tests can also be embedded in the same mixset or can be defined in a separate one. The only issue that need to be handled is that dependency between mixsets. If your test case contains an instantiated object that uses attribute in a particular mixset then either embed the tests within the mixset to avoid errors or make sure you always switch-on the targeted feature to avoid instantiation errors. Currently, this is not caught by the compiler but will be added.
