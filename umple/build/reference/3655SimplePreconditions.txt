@@description

<p>You can specify basic preconditions in methods as shown below. Like other constraints, they are specified in square brackets. Precondition appears as the first lines of a method and must start with &apos;pre:&apos;. A precondition can refer to one or more attributes or method arguments. If a precondition is not satisfied when the method is run an exception will be thrown; in Java a RuntimeException is used.</p>
