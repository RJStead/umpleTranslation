Umple user Manual files are defined in this directory

The order of the sections in the manual is determined by the order.group file.

Each numbered file represents the source code for one of the user manual pages.
In each numbered file:
  - The first line indicates the title of the page. With spaces removed, this also becomes the last component of the URL of the page. As a result, avoid renaming pages since links will become stale. And also, therefore think carefully before naming a page.
  - The second line of the file determines the section of the manual. The section must match one of the entries in order.group
  - the third line would normally say 'noreferences' since we have turned off an obsolete feature for generating references.
  
The numbering sequence of the files is used to help order the files. But the order specified by order.group has precedence.

Within each manual page, you specify sections delineated by @@description, @@syntax and @@example/@@endexample etc.

Use html in the @@description.

Code in the examples will be rendered using syntaxHighlighter. This is found in umplewww. If you are making your own local version of the manual, you will have to create a symbolic link to that directory.

A link will be generated from each code example to ensure that it can be displayed in UmpleOnline. Always test and comment code samples.

Instructions for building deploying the user manual can be found here: https://github.com/umple/Umple/wiki/Deploying
In short: to build on your local environment
cd trunk/build
ant -Dmyenv=local -f build.umple.xml packageDocs
then
open <yourumpledir>/dist/cruise.umple/reference/GettingStarted.html

Diagrams can be embedded in selected pages. These are stored in umplewww/examples
Diagrams must be promoted on the server when they are created or changed. This is not done automatically.

The program that generates the user manual is called umpledocs.jar
Code for this can be found in:
cruise.umple/src/Documenter.ump
and
cruise.umple/src/Documenter_Code.ump
