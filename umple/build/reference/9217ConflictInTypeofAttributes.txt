<h2>Umple semantic error related to having an attribute from a trait with different types</h2>

<p align = "justify">
We can define template parameters for traits and use them with different bindings in several hierarchy paths. If types of some attributes are based on template parameters,  there is a case in which those are bound with different values. In a case that a trait is going to be used in a diamond form of hierarchy, this can result in a conflict. Note that if the types are the same, then there is no conflict.
