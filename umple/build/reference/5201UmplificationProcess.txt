Umplification Process

@@description
<p>To start, source files with language L (e.g. Java, C++) code are initially renamed as Umple files, with extension <b>.ump</b>.</p>
<p> Then, iteratively, small transformations are performed that
gradually add UML abstractions. Each iteration should involve testing to check that the programâ€™s semantics are preserved. </p>
</br>
<p>
Umplification can be performed automatically by a reverse engineering technology that can parse a program in any native programming language and extract the Umple model from it. </p>
