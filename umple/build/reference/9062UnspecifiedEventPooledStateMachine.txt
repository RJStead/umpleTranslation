<h2>Umple semantic warning issued when the event &#34;unspecified&#34; is used in a pooled state machine </h2>

<p>
A pooled state machine cannot use the &#34;unspecified&#34; event in a transition. This is because the unspecified functionality is designed to handle events that occur unexpectedly, which only makes sense in a regular and pooled state machine. Pooled state machines instead just leave such events on the queue, and process events further back in the queue.
In a pooled state machine, an event with the &#34;unspecified&#34; label is treated as a regular event and will be pooled. <br/>
To catch and immediately process unspecified events, a queued or regular state machine could be used instead.
