@@tooltip Use wildcard characters to select methods in which to inject code

@@description
<p>When creating before and after statements, you
can arrange for the code to be injected into certain
methods that match a pattern. You can use * as a wildcard, and ! as an
exclusion operator. The following examples will both generate the
same code.</p>

<p>Another example of pattern matching for code injection can be found
on the <a href="PooledStateMachines.html">page on pooled state machines, where the same code is injected into all the event methods matching a certain pattern</a></p>

<p>You can specify that code should be injected only into generated methods by specifying the word &apos;generated&apos; after before or after. Similarly you can specify only custom methods using the keyword &apos;custom&apos;. The keyword &apos;all&apos; indicates to inject the code into all matching methods.</p>
