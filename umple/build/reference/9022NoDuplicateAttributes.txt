@@description

<h2>Umple semantic error reported when a class is given two attributes with the same name.</h2>

<p>Attributes in a class must have distinct names. The solution to this error is to rename or delete one of the attributes. This error is particularly prone to appear when a class is composed of two or more files using Umple&apos;s &apos;mixin&apos; capability; the attribute should be defined in one file or the other, but not both.
