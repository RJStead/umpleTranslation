<h2>Umple semantic warning issued when a state is non-reachable</h2>

<p>
A state that is never the destination state of a transition in the state machine or is not 
the initial state of the state machine is considered non-reachable by the Umple compiler.
The generated methods will not assign this state to the machine.
<br/>
The warning can be avoided by removing the non-reachable state or by adding an 
appropriate transition to the state machine.
