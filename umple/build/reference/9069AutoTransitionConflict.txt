<h2>Umple semantic warning issued when an auto-transition has a conflict with a previously defined transition</h2>

<p>
An auto-transition in a state that is declared after another auto-transition will be ignored, and only the 
first auto-transition will be executed. No warning is issued if the destination state
of both auto-transitions is the same.
