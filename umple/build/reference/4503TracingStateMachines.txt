<p align="justify">
State machines are representations of system behaviour. States can have entry or exit actions and do activities; they can also be composite (i.e. nested) or concurrent. MOTL provides modellers with the capability of specifying tracing for all these modelling elements. 
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>State machine</b>: State Machines can be traced as a whole, considering all states, nested states, events, etc.</li>
<li><b>State</b>: Tracing a state involves the tracing of its entry/exit actions, incoming/outgoing events, and do-activities. In case of composite states, all nested states will be traced accordingly.</li>
<li><b>Event</b>: A targeted event can be traced specifically. Tracing an event records previous state before the triggering of the traced event with the resulting new state after the transition.</li>
</ul>
