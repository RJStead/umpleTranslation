<h2>Umple semantic warning reported when an identifier in a key statement was not found</h2>

<p>The list of identifiers in a key statement can include attributes, associations (role name for example) or state machines. This message indicates that the referenced identifier could not be found. This is usually the result of a typographical error. The extraneous identifier is ignored, which is likely to result in incorrect code.
