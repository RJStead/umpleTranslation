<h2>Umple semantic warning reported when Umple finds an un-parsable element in a class, which is likely a malformed attribute, association, method or state machine declaration.</h2>

<p>Umple emits such elements 'as is' (or what we call 'extra code') in its generated code, in case they are some part of the base language that Umple cannot understand.
