@@description

<p>An abstract method is a method declaration with no implementation. These methods are to be implemented in classes 
with the specific behaviour intended. </p> 

<p>Abstract methods can be defined in classes using the keyword &#34;abstract&#34;, followed by
the method&#39;s signature. By declaring a method abstract, the class containing it is abstract as well, meaning no instances
of it can be created (the new keyword cannot be used to create an object of the class). The abstract class
must have one or more subclasses that have concrete implementations of the abstract method.</p>

<p>An interface can only contain abstract methods, and the keyword is not needed. The usage
of the abstract keyword in a trait <a href="ClientsofTraits.html"> declares a required method. </a> </p>
