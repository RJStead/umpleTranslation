@@description

<h2>Umple warning generated when there is a duplicate unguarded event that will never be reached, in the situation where there is a superstate and a substate with the same event</h2>

<p>
In the example below, the event e from the s1 superstate and the event e in the s1a substate are ambiguous. Current semantics is that the event in the superstate takes precedence, but this semantics may be changed.
