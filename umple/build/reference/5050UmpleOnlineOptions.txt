@@description
<p>UmpleOnline allows you to append various options to its URLi, enabling
startup in a certain state. These are preceded by an ampersand, except the first
in a list which would be preceded by a question mark.</p>

<ul>

<li>?nochrome: Hide the header of the UmpleOnline page (sometimes called the chrome) so only the model is visible.<p>

<li>?nodiagram: Don't show any diagram, in order to show the text only.<p>

<li>?diagramtype=GvClass: By default show graphviz class diagrams instead of editable diagrams.<p>

<li>?diagramtype=state: By default show graphviz state diagrams instead of editable class diagrams.<p>

<li>?notext: Don't show Umple text (doesn't have any effect if the diagram is also hidden).<p>

<li>?nomenu: Hide the middle menu. Either ?notext or ?nodiagram must also be present.<p>

<li>?readOnly: Turn off editing capability - use for display only.<p>

<li>?filename=xxxxx: Load the model xxxxx. xxxxx is a URL with the leading http:// left off.<p>

</ul>
