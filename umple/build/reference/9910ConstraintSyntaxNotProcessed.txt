<h2>Umple semantic warning issued when the syntax of a constraint cannot be processed</h2>

<p>When a constraint-like syntax is found but it cannot be processed by Umple, it is treated
as extra code and left as-is. The constraint might not be constructed properly. <br/>
The issue could come from unmatched parentheses or from an incorrect usage of operators.
