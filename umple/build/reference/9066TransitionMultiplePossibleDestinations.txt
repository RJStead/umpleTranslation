<h2>Umple semantic warning issued when a transition has multiple possible destinations</h2>

<p>
If a transition&#39;s destination state name has multiple occurrences in the state machine,
this warning will be issued, as it is possible the developer means to reference a specific
substate of the same name. The dot notation should be used to clarify which substate is 
intended to be the destination state.
<br/>
The transition destination is by default the highest level state in the state machine.
In the case of multiple states at the same level using the same state name, 
Umple currently assumes the state that has been defined first is being referenced.
