@@description

<h2>Umple semantic error reported when an association to an interface is declared to be bidirectional or pointing from the interface.</h2>

<p>An association can be declared from a class to an interface, but if this is done, it must be one way using the '->' notation. The reason for this is that no concrete methods can be generated in an interface.
