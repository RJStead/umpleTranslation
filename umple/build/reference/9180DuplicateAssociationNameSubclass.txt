<h2>Umple semantic error reported when a subclass has an association that is not a specialization, but where the association has the same name as the superclass association</h2>

<p>A subclass can not have an association with the same role name as an association of its superclass, unless it is a valid specialization. A valid specialization would be to the same class, but with a refined multiplicity (see the second example) 
</p>
