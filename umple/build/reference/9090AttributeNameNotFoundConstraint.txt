<h2>Umple semantic error raised when a class does not contain an attribute of a given name specified in a constraint</h2>

<p>
Model constraints can be applied to Umple classes to ensure they respect certain properties, as defined in their constraints.
This error is raised if a class does not contain an attribute with a name specified in the constraint.<br/>
The attribute might have been defined in a separate file previously, but no longer exists, causing the error.
