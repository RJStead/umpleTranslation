@@tooltip Use statements to incorporate the contents of another Umple file or activate a mixset

@@description
<p>Use statements allow you to decompose your system by embedding or referencing
files containing other model or program entities (i.e. classes) within your current model or to include optional
blocks of code that are specified within <a href="BasicMixsets.html">mixsets</a>.</p>

<p>A model file or mixset will only be included once, subsequent "use" commands 
for the same file will be ignored.</p>

<p>A common technique is to create a 'master' Umple file that does nothing but have a list
of use statements.</p>

<p>Parts of an individual class can be specified in separate files, and brought together using several use statements. For example the associations or attributes could be in one (or several) files, and the methods could be in one (or more) additional files.</p>

<p>Another way to decompose a system is to have a 'core' set of files that can be included in several different systems using use statements.</p>

<p>Use statements work in a manner similar to 'include' directives in other languages.</p>
