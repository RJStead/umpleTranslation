<h2>Umple semantic error reported when concurrent substates are placed at the top level of a state machine</h2>

<p>A state machine must be in one top level state at all times. Concurrent substates can exist in any substate at any level, but not directly in a top level state. The second example below shows how this can be handled simply by adding a level of nesting.</p>

<p>If the intent is simply to create concurrent do activities, an alternative is to use Umple&#39;s active objects notation.
