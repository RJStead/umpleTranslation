@@description

<h2>Umple semantic error reported when a non-directed association is declared to be immutable, or appears in an immutable class.</h2>

<p>Allowing two-way associations to be immutable would be impossible since it would require change to one object when it is linked to the other, and that would break the concept of immutability.
