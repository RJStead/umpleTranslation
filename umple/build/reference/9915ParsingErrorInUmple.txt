<h2>Umple error messages reported when the Umple parser can't interpret the code.</h2>

<p>These messages occur in several contexts:<br>
<ul>
<li>There is a typographical error in one of the <a href="TypesofDirectives.html">directives</a> specified outside a class declaration. Umple does not recognize the keyword.
<li>The syntax (i.e. arguments) to one of the <a href="TypesofDirectives.html">directives</a> such as 'generate' or 'use' is not properly typed.
<li>There is a missing semicolon at the end of a directive, or a missing space separating elements of the syntax.
<li>The overall structure of an umple element does not conform to the Umple grammar. For example specifying a <a href=""ClassDefinition.html>class</a> without a name, or without a body in curly brackets.
</ul>
</p>
