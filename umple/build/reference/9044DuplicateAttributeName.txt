@@description

<h2>Umple semantic warning reported when an attribute in a class is a duplicate of an attribute in a superclass
and their types differ.</h2>

<p>The purpose of this warning is to alert the developer that they have to resolve the issue by changing the name of the duplicated attribute in either the superclass or subclass, or else remove one of them entirely, as you should not define an attribute twice with a different type. 
</p>
