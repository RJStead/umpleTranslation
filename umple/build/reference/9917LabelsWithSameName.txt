<h2> Warning reporting that code labels inside methods should have unique names.</h2>

<p> Code Labels allow aspects to inject code in specific locations inside method bodies. However, the code injection is only applied to the first encountered label. Therefore, a code label should not be reused multiple times (inside a method). </p>

<p>If you encounter this warning, you can easily rename code labels with unique names for each label inside the method body.  <br/>
