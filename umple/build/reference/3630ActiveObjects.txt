@@description

<p>An active object is an object that, when constructed, runs its own thread. This is indicated in Umple by the 'active' keyword followed by a block of code. A collection of active objects, working together, constitute a concurrent system.</p>

<p>Additional Umple features are under development to allow for sending signals to and from concurrent objects.</p>
