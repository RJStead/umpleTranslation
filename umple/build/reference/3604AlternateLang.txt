@@description

<p>In Umple, the body of a method will by default be emitted unchanged. This ties the model to the particular programming language. However it is possible to provide alternative implementations for different programming languages by preceding the method body with the language name.</p>

<p>This multi-lingual capability also works for other places where native code is injected such as in <a href="StateMachineActionsandDoActivities.html">state machine guards and actions</a>, or in <a href="DerivedAttributes.html">derived attributes.</a></p>
