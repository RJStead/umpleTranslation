<h2>Umple semantic error raised when an association with an abstract class forces instantiation of an object</h2>

<p>An association with an abstract class must either be a directed association or must have a multiplicity with lower bound
of zero at both ends. This is necessary to prevent situations where it would be needed to instantiate the abstract class (which
is never allowed).<br/>
