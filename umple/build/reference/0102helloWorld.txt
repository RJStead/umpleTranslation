@@tooltip Basic examples showing how Umple code is written

@@description
<p>As is customary when introducing a new language, here are some 'hello world' examples for Umple. Load these examples into UmpleOnline by clicking on the links. Then generate Java code by clicking on the 'Generate' button. Next click on the 'download zip file' link and run 'javac' on the result or else compile it in Eclipse.</p>

<p><b>First example below:</b> This looks identical to how a Java 'hello world' example would look, illustrating a key feature of Umple: Umple <i>adds</i> features to existing languages: Code in the original language can and does remain the same. Umple just replaces and simplifies some (or a lot) of it.</p>


<p><b>Second example below:</b> This shows some very simple features of Umple: An attribute, an association, a generalization, some Java methods and the mixin capability:<br/>
<ul>
<li><a href="AttributeDefinition.html">Attributes</a> look very much like variables in Java or other similar programming languages; however they are more than that: Umple generates code for setting and getting each attribute. You can also add lots of other features to attributes, such as making them immutable (so they cannot change), adding constraints, or making them part of a 'key'.</p>
<li>An <a href="AssociationDefinition.html">association</a> such as the one shown here maintains links between objects at run-time. Here the student can get its mentors, and the mentor can find his or her optional student.
<li>A <a href="isAclause.html">generalization</a>, as in other object-oriented language, sets up inheritance relationships. Umple uses the 'isA' keyword. Here both Student and Mentor inherit the name attribute.
<li>The <a href="MethodDefinition.html">methods</a> in the example are just normal Java methods. If you generate java from this, compile using javac, and then run the Person class using java, its main program will run.
<li>You will notice that Person is apparently defined twice. This is a feature of Umple called using 'mixin' technology. All the elements are combined to create the resulting class.
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Umple and UML:</b> Here is the class diagram of the second example in UML. If you click on the 'open in UmpleOnline' link, you will see the UML diagram generated. You can then edit the UML diagram to change the code, or change the code to edit the UML diagram.</p>
